Northern banks are very important now because they're warmer than other areas on the lake. Avoid places hit by cold north winds. Once the water hits 50 degrees, bass are definitely in a prespawn mode. Migration routes are important now in lakes and reservoirs. Bass will follow ditches, depth contours, tapering points and fallen trees on sloping banks toward shallower water. If there's some stain to the water, a deep running crawfish pattern crankbait rooted along the bottom is strong now; bass feed heavily on crawfish emerging from hibernation during the late winter/early spring transition period.";

Large expanses of shallow water are critical (10 feet or less on a lowland reservoir or natural lake, 8 to 20 feet deep on a highland reservoir). Look for areas on a contour map where the lines are spread far apart, not close together. If the female is on her bed then the male is close by, he will keep anything away from the female. You can tempt females to strike your lure but you have to get right up on her to agitate her. Long plastic worms and tubes work well. Colors are natural colors like watermelon seed or pumpkin seed.

Try to target either the fish that spawned earliest and are moving out toward their summer digs, or the late bedders. When bass leave their beds, they're likely to hang around their spawning grounds awhile. Cover that's sticking up vertically from the bottom is very important now. They'll hang around boat dock pilings, submerged bushes or the trunk of a standing tree. You'll often see bass suspending near the surface now, looking like they're sunning themselves. Most bass are not very aggressive and won't feed much right after spawning, but they can be tempted to bite a reaction-type lure. Senkos, plastic worms and other lures that can go through cover while avoiding a snag. Color is again natural.";

Bass migrate back onto the main body of water, where they hang around channel-oriented structure: humps, points, dropoffs, ledges. Your best bet in the first part of this phase is a slow tapering point at the mouth of a spawning cove. As the weeks progress you can find bass in sheltered areas such as cover, brush, and trees. Crankbaits, spinnerbaits and any other lures that cause a commotion when retreiving will work great. Plastic lures such as grubs, tubes, and senkos are also great. Use tubes and grubs if you know the bottum us rocky. Senkos if there is a lot of cover and snaggy. Natural colors are good to go with, they make bass thing the food is just a smaller fish.";

In reservoirs, cooling water causes vast numbers of shad to migrate into tributary arms, and bass are close behind. Follow this migration by fishing the first third of creek arms in early fall, then gradually pressing farther back into the tributary as the surface temperature drops. I'll often idle my boat up a creek arm, watching my graph for suspended shad schools or looking for bait flipping on the surface. Isolated wood cover or boat docks in the backs of creek arms are dependable fall bass patterns. In lakes that don't have shad, bass feed heavily on bluegill and shiners, both grass-oriented species, so target weedy areas. Natural color is important, you must look and act like a baitfish. Acting wounded is good as well.";
